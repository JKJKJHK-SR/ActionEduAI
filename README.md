An intelligent educational framework integrating action recognition, cognitive modeling, and reinforcement learning to enhance interactivity and personalization in learning environments.

## Overview

This project introduces an innovative AI-powered framework that brings **action recognition** into **educational environments**, enabling interactive, adaptive, and personalized learning experiences. Traditional instructional systems often fail to respond to real-time student behavior, leading to disengagement and limited educational outcomes.

To address these challenges, we propose the integration of two core modules:

- **AKEN (Adaptive Knowledge Evolution Network)**: A deep learning model that captures dynamic knowledge state transitions in learners and personalizes content accordingly.
- **CALS (Cognitive-Adaptive Learning Strategy)**: A reinforcement learning-based strategy that optimizes instructional decisions by balancing engagement, knowledge retention, and cognitive load.

## Key Features

- Action recognition for real-time learner behavior interpretation
- Knowledge evolution modeling to track learner progress
- Reinforcement learning for personalized learning path adaptation
- Real-time feedback mechanisms to boost engagement
- Scalable to various subject domains and learner profiles

## Architecture

### AKEN

- Learns evolving cognitive states from user interactions
- Integrates real-time behavioral and feedback signals
- Personalizes instructional content delivery dynamically

### CALS

- Reinforcement learning module for instructional strategy optimization
- Balances difficulty, engagement, and knowledge reinforcement
- Supports long-term learning outcome maximization

## Experimental Results

| Metric                     | Traditional Systems | AKEN + CALS Framework |
|----------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Engagement Score           | 0.65                | 0.89                   |
| Personalized Feedback Rate | 72%                 | 91%                    |
| Learning Outcome Gain      | 18%                 | 34%                    |
